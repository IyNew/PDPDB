Prereq: Your environment needs to have [GMP](https://gmplib.org) library and [PBC](https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/) library.

For both libraries, you can install them easily by following the manual. When you see errors during the installation, google the error and you'll find a solution in most cases.

After installing the libraries, to execute the code and measure the run time on your own machine, please run the following command:

`sh timing.sh`
